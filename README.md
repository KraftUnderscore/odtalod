# Oh dear, that's a lot of deer!
This game was created for the Quarantine Jam in 2020. It's a short, fun and cute game where you're trying to help your grandma achieve
her grand dream by making a deer ranch for her.

All sprites except the tiles was done by me using Aseprite. Tileset - Zelda-like tilesets and sprites by ArMM1998 from OpenGameArt.org

All sounds except background music was generated using sfxr. Background music - Happy Arcade Tune by rezoner from OpenGameArt.org

To-do post jam:
- [ ] clean up the code
- [ ] fix bugs that appeared during jam
- [ ] reduce timer to 3 minutes
- [ ] improve the interaction with deer (more focus on inviduals rather than making hundreds of deer)
- [ ] sort out z-order artifacts
- [ ] improve sound effects
